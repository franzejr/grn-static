Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by xenor.

#### Rails Bricks

The author of [Rails Bricks][railsbricks], Nico Schuele, suddenly removed all
his works and disappeared from the ruby/rails community.

I got really sad when reading the [quora postuora_link]. Especially when Nico
said he replied many emails about using the site, but only got a few that
actually reply or just a simple 'thanks'.

When an open source project gets bigger, and there is only one man on it, it
feels lonely and stressful. I don't really think money is the reason that made
Nico give up, it's the lack of emotional support that started off his fire.

So, if you are using an open source project, please give your best thanks to
the authors. Sometimes just a star or :+1: is really enough and can probably
save another Rails Bricks.
