Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by xenor.

#### Physical Health of Developers

This is the first time for me to release the newsletter without our dear
friend mose, who is currently in fever and need to take some days to recover.
Recently I've been noticed that some developers including me suffering from
small or big health issues.

The reason sometimes is obvious, when developer's mode is on, it sticks for
hours without leaving our screen and keyboard. Even when taking a break, we
are still on smaller screens or keyboards (tablet, mobile...etc). Our mind
keeps running and sometimes physical requirements just seems unnecessary. So,
after several stays up or absences of meals, it happened.

Am I going to suggest standing up and doing outdoor activities? Hell no! The
desire of gathering and absorbing information is what makes us strong, our
body is just the minimum support for our mind.

So what should we do? Well, eat, drink, rest, and grab a keyboard to type!
