Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### Xenor release

This weekend Xenor, our dear Green Ruby editor, could not provide his links
like he does every week. He was busy on another release. Please join me to
congrat Xenor for his second kid that is in progress of being released at this
very moment.

It may be a generational thing, I notice that a lot of geeks around me are
reproducing this year. Maybe it's just a coincidence. But as a result the
mindset of those new parents may evolve a bit. The priorities get to change a
bit too. As far as I know, coder have been tricked for a while into working
over hours just because they like what they do. Well, growing a family
certainly changes the deal.

But those geeks I know that became new parents are in their thirties. Maybe
that's how things are done nowadays, people get kids later in life than in
previous generation? Or is it a factor localized to the technical population?
Because the expectations of the work environment for a full no-life
dedication, techies may delay their family building projects? I have to say
I'm wondering.
