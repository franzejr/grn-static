Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### RubyConf Taiwan 2015 CFP

Hey it's time to give it a try, talking at a rubyconf is a great upgrade for
any coder. That rubyconf will happen on september 11-12th in Taipei. [Check it
out][rubyconf].

#### NSA on Github

Looks like someone is trying to fight back a reputation of obscurity. While
they are still pushing on more invasion of privacy, they also release some
[open source code][nsaoss]. Check the [NSA github repository][nsa], they
released something already. [Simp][simp] especially has a bunch of puppet
modules, but it's designed only for redhat kind of systems. Quite an
interesting move.

[rubyconf]:
