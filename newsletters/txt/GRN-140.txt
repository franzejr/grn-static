Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### Slack overflow

Okay I reckon I'm very old school. I began on the net with irc and I still
stick to it. I have been confused by the trend that make people use Twitter
like if it was some kind of real-time interactive medium. I have watched skype
becoming unavoidable, and despicable. I hope [Telegram][telegram] will kill
it, honestly.

I have been using hipchat and slack for work. Hipchat was really cool, but
slack came later on and seemed more modern and featurefull. But it didn't have
a linux client for a while. So I didn't really played much with it. But now
there is a linux client, and it seems that there is an ecosystem nuilding up
around slack. As they don't charge for normal usage until you need many
integrations with various services, it's pretty easy for anyone to create some
new slack team.

Slack was first designed for teams, and those teams are gathered by invite
only. But there are many ways to smooth it up to create some open discussion
area that could be compared to irc. But in a way that it includes features
that on irc I had to settle myself. For example for sharing code on irc you
typically use some pastebin, jsfiddle, or other service of the same kind. In
slack code can be pasted in directly or uploaded as a file. For keeping some
kind of permanence I always use weechat in a screen on a remote server. That
way I never disconnect form irc and I can backlog when I get back. But this is
not for everybody and slack has the same kind of feature. But the most
noticeable feature in slack is the mobile integration. It beats irc without a
doubt.

Given those benefits, various communities begin to switch from irc to slack.
There are even people building up a business creating communities on slack.
Check [slacklist][slacklist] or the [chat directory][cdir]. Some of those
slack teams are open, some others are accessible after a review process, some
others you have to pay a fee to access them.

I would not say that slack replaces irc, to be honest, even if it fulfills
some similar goal. It's a totally different beast. Plus, that's a third party
that keeps all your logs. If security of your content is an issue, you should
rather have an internal irc server or try an open source self-hosted slack
alternative.

Currently I got 6 groups on my slack client, including the [Greenruby slack
group][greenslack]. You can ask for an invite at
[slack@greenruby.org][grnmail] it's totally open.
