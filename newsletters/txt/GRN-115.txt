Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### State surveillance in France

What happened this week in France is quite shocking. How can they be so long
to make useful laws and so quick to pass harmful ones? Well the move began in
[December last year][frenchpatriot]. Some call it a French Patriot act. This
is not the first time there is an attempt from French government to enforce
stronger control on the internet. The pressure of lobbies and media industries
have been pushing hard to preserve their interests.

But this time, it's just about copying the NSA, and get legal requirement for
service providers to host the black boxes. Seems that the Snowden revelations
gave the lawmakers some ideas. The impact is not anecdotal in the French
society. Some service providers announce they will leave the country like
[Altern][altern] (French), others [call to action][laurent] (French). Both
Valentin and Laurent are long time activists in the French landscape. I know
them for a while. Funny how things turn out, I'm now working in the company
they founded in 99 (and passed hands in 2005).

But all this makes me think that we are facing a technicality. The real thing
is systemic. It seems that we failed, as a civilization, to regain control
over our systems. The course of evolution is going to lead to more control to
the machines, more dependence on the computerized information. Up to a point
where our insignificance as human being will become really obvious.

We, as small makers of this computerized universe, should have some part of
responsibility. Is there a way that we can bend the course of history by the
small choices we make? Can we not take decisions in regard of how to implement
solutions, in a way that we can preserve a margin of freedom and respect for
the human species? I'm not sure, at this point, there is anything we can do.
But if we don't try, we will never know. Think about it. You build systems.
You shape the world. Your choice matters.
