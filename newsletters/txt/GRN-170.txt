Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### It's the fault of the bike

Well, in the last two weeks I get short in links gathered on our slack pinned
list. Usually I'm reading various RSS feeds while commuting, and I post them
on slack, for later one pinning them. Then I have a script in go that will
grab all the pinned url, and remove the pins at the moment I use and check
them for inclusion in the publication.

But 2 weeks ago, I decided to change my habits and go to the office by bike.
It's a 30 minutes ride, and it's very good. But then hare we are: no no way to
check RSS on the phone. I'm going to need to find another trick. Because I
won't quit the biking.
