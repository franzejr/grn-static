Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### Aprils lame fools

I think there is nothing I hate more than pranks. It's just another way to
bully someone else. Even innocent pranks are having victims. Single out the
one that fall for it to make laugh the ones that don't. Well, I may very well
be a boring fellow. Or it's just that, working so much with information
management, any perversion of it seems off.

And then on april fools day, so much goes wrong. The net becomes unreliable.
So lame. But I'm not sure if it's the reason there are not that many news
articles this week.
