Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### 150 weeks

It's kind of a round number, this 150th edition of the Green Ruby Newsletter
is an occasion to see where we are. At this day there are 1,610 subscribers to
the email newsletter. The website has around 250 unique visits per day, which
mostly are RSS readers. Those are anecdotal numbers. As we have no intention
to monetize this initiative, it doesn't matter that much. Soon we will enter
in the red zone in the amount of subscribers and we will need to push some
people out, those who forgot about the newsletter but also forgot to
unsubscribe. It will happen when we reach 1,800 (because Mailchimp is still
free under 2,000 subscribers).

During the whole life of the publication, we never missed one week. Last week,
thanks to Xenor, I even could have some rest. Now I'm better, flu never last.
We also have, for a couple of months, much more links contributions (thanks
Nauman Tariq). All in all, our model seems to have been pretty sustainable.
