Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### a taste of FreeBSD

This weekend I installed [FreeBSD][freebsd] 10.1 on a disk of my desktop.
Beyond the fact that we are using that system at work, more and more, I was
just curious about the setup for a desktop. I was pleasantly surprised and
everything went very smoothly.

I'm quite familiar with Linux and that was enough for making the ride very
easy. The general impression is that actually the system is simpler than on
Linux, maybe more consistent. The pkg system, alternative to the traditional
ports system, makes thing much more 'out of the box'.

And for the rest, well, in one afternoon, and just by following the doc, I had
my window manager up and running, and ready to begin playing with
[bhyve][bhyve]. I was surprised to see that bhyve kernel modules were included
by default in recent releases. I heard there are still some bumps on the road
for laptop about the sleep to disk mode, but I'm not concerned by that.

It feels like BSD is a shy actor that actually powers much more stuff that we
can suspect. But it has a pretty active community and a very decent
documentation. Well, give it a try if you like playing with various
distributions of free and open operating systems. It's much less scary that
its reputation seems to convey.
