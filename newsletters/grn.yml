    "#### No rant this week


Well it's not the first time. I just don't feel inspired. So I better shut up rather than writing useless rant. It's so easy to fill up space with meaningless content. But I'm not doing that ever. I only speak out when I have something to say. And yes, I'm very comfortable to contradict myself by writing a useless rant. This is the beauty of the human being: our ability to abstract makes possible all sort of paradoxes. Wait, is it related to abstractions? hmm, This is a great topic for my day-dreaming in the subway. Oh, damn I'm late. Cya all and have a good week.
