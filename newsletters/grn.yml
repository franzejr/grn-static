  "#### Green Ruby New Generation


We had this week a very productive meeting with xenor and tysliu in our preferred coffee shop. I explained more in detail my workflow and my quality criterias. So now they can feed the links section and become the major editors of Green Ruby. I Still keep the role of the publisher. I get their links, I clean up stuff, verify freshness and reachability, remove superlatives, fix category if needed. 


Special thanks a lot to Xenor and Tysliu (aka. Simon). Now they do the heavy lifting and they are the reason why Green Ruby is still in your mailbox every week.
