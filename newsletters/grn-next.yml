    "#### Physical Health of Developers

    This is the first time for me to release the newsletter without our dear friend mose, who is currently in fever and need to take some days to recover. Recently I've been noticed that some developers including me suffering from small or big health issues.

    The reason sometimes is obvious, when developer's mode is on, it sticks for hours without leaving our screen and keyboard. Even when taking a break, we are still on smaller screens or keyboards (tablet, mobile...etc). Our mind keeps running and sometimes physical requirements just seems unnecessary. So, after several stays up or absences of meals, it happened.

    Am I going to suggest standing up and doing outdoor activities? Hell no! The desire of gathering and absorbing information is what makes us strong, our body is just the minimum support for our mind.

    So what should we do? Well, eat, drink, rest, and grab a keyboard to type!
