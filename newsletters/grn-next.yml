There have been some noise last week about npm, coming from [that article][liberated_modules]. It merely revealed that various open source organization are privately held by soem individuals and they can either be pressured or take weird decisions. Honestly I consider this incident anecdotal. I would bet it's not the first time such thing happens. One guy just happened to be very vocal and pissed off about it.

There are some other organizations, backed by some fundation, where such process is more complicated. Some have lawyers, IP consultants. But most open source organizations are operating in a legal void. Honestly, I really like it that way.
