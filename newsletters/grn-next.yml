  Rails Bricks - xenor

  The author of [Rails Bricks][railsbricks], Nico Schuele, suddenly remove all his works and seems disappear from the ruby/rails community. Here is [why][quora_link].

  From reading the quora, it makes me really sad, especially when Nico said he replied many emails about asking questions for using the site, but only get a few that actually reply nor a simple 'thanks'.

  When an open source project gets bigger, and there is only one man on it, it feels alone and stressful. I don't really think money is the reason that makes Nico gave up, it's the lack of emotional support that put off his fire.

  So, if you are using an open source project, please give your best thanks to the author, sometimes just a star or :+1: is really enough and can probably save another Rails Bricks.
