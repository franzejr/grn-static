  "#### RubyConf Taiwan 2015


In september 11 and 12 there is a [Rubyconf here in Taiwan][rubyconf]. I have been at some past editions and it's always a good time to meet people. Because we are close to Japan there is usually pretty good ruby core contributors from there. We get to see Matz, father of ruby, at each edition. But this time it seems that the organizers pulled some kind of special trick and the famous [Aaron Paterson][tenderlove] will be present. And I remember having heard [Sarah Allen on rubyrogues][sarah] last year, it the first time she joins us in Taiwan too.


If you looked for an occasion to visit Taiwan, that may tbe the right time. You won't regret it. The ruby community in Taiwan is quite active and taiwanese people are amazingly welcoming to westerners.


And, if you want to meet the 3 of us, we will all be there. Look around for Xenor and Tysliu, the famous editors of the Green Ruby newsletter. They tirelessly collect links and news, fresh from the week, about ruby and other things. We probably will distribute some green ruby stickers that I still have in stock. So then we can make new ones.
