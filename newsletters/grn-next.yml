  "#### Rubyconftw - xenor


Hey I'm xenor and this is my first rant in Green Ruby News about (and not about) [rubyconftw][rubyconf].


I work in a ruby shop and manage a couple of people, I am recently feeling burned-out. It affects motivation and productivity. I am in a position which involves watching over colleagues output. But I also have my own coding projects ongoing.


At first it's great and challenging. But after half a year, it starts to bite me back. I get tired and anxious about not
  meeting my goal at the end of the day while checking others progress. I also need more breaks than usual. The typical burn-out syndrome.


Rubyconf gave me a break so that I can rethink what I was doing and how I can evaluate things around me. During the conference, I found some time to do [side project][squeezer]. This really helps and re-motivates me on programming (I believe this could be called 'Conference Driven Development')


You might wonder why I didn't say anything about the talks. Actually, talks are just as great as all other conferences, and can be watched on the recordings that they will post soon. But the most important part is really the atmosphere of encouragement to try and learn something new.
