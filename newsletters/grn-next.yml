  "#### Rubyconftw - xenor

  This is my first rant in Green Ruby News, and it's about (and not about) rubyconftw.

  I am recently feeling burned-out on current job, this feeling affect my motivation and productivity.
  The reason of it is because I am in a position which needs to watch over colleagues output but also having my own projects ongoing.
  At first it's great and challenging, but after half year, it starts to bite me back with tireness and anxious about not
  meeting my goal at the end of the day while cheking others' progress. It also leads me to a state that I need more breaks than usual -- which is the typical burned-out syndrome.

  Rubyconf actually give me a break and breathe so that I can rethink what I was doing and how I can approve things around me.
  And during the conference, I found some time to do [side project], this really helps and motivates me again on programming (I believe this can be called 'Event Driven Development')
  You might wonder why I didn't say anything about the talks. IMHO, talks are just as great as all other conferences, and can be watched again few days aftar through recordings.
  It's the atmosphere encourages people to try and learn something new, which to me, is the most important part.
