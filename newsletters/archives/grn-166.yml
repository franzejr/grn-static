    "#### Go again


That's years that I'm trying to do something real with go. I mean, it is a very attractive language with quite a special workflow and toolbox. From time to time I write some small script for keeping contact with that language. Last week I made [this one][slackpin] to list links pinned in our Greenruby slackroom to prepare the letter, So I can open them all at once to check them in my browser. With time passing, seems that Go now has a really complete collection of libraries for a lot of usages. I think I will have push a little the slack api soon, and maybe do some real go coding.
