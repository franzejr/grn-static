    "#### Busy hackathon in Taipei


This weekend we had our first [hackathon][hackathon] in Taipei, organized by [Gandi][gandi]. That was pretty fun, to be there on the side of the organizers without actually being in charge of the organization for once. Such geek events are always so great for meeting and sharing, being forbidden to participate didn't prevent me to push some ideas around.


During the course of the weekend, I joined mickey to push the creation of a [Taiwan group for Elixir][elixirtw], for which we had an idea of a stream capture feature to gather slack discussion and index them. I also had an idea of event for [FreeBSD portscamp][portscamp] with marcelo, so we made a FreeBSD Taiwan group on github as well (with a pretty neat logo). All this was actually not that much related to the hackathon but just emerging from natural proximity with other geeks.
