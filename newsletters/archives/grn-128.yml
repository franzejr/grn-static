  "#### RubyConf Taiwan 2015 CFP


Hey it's time to give it a try, talking at a rubyconf is a great upgrade for any coder. That rubyconf will happen on september 11-12th in Taipei. [Check it out][rubyconf].


#### NSA on Github


Looks like someone is trying to fight back a reputation of obscurity. While they are still pushing on more invasion of privacy, they also release some [open source code][nsaoss]. Check the [NSA github repository][nsa], they released something already. [Simp][simp] especially has a bunch of puppet modules, but it's designed only for redhat kind of systems. Quite an interesting move.
