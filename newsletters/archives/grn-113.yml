  "#### Multiple inheritance simulation


This is a bit twisted. In ruby, as you know, you cannot use multiple inheritance. But the flexibility of the language, especially the metaprogramming aspect, opens the door for some cheating. Check out [this code][inheritance], it tricks it by declaring the first class as the super class and the remaining classes as modules included in that super class. Pretty acrobatic and elegant, imho.


#### About vaping


Well this has been my burden for 30 years, and I'm not proud of it. But last week it finally ended. I quit smoking. But this was kindof a trick, as it was made possible by switching to [vaping][vaping]. It certainly doesn't solve the nicotine addiction issue, but I'm very happy with this move and hopeful for a gradual freedom.


I also found out that this vaping practice is very geeky. The hardware part is quite elaborate, vaping devices are really neat piece of work, there are a bunch of vendors. The liquidware is also quite a subject of hacking. Technically it's not that hard to do it yourself. Not surprising that I discovered this vaping practice in geeks circles.
