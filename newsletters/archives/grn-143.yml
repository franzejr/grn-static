    "#### The power of DSL


While I was playing with [react.rb][reactrb] and exploring [opal][opal], I felt in a totally different world. The power of the DSL already prove its shine on various occasions. I got to experience it in activeadmin, rspec, and puppet (but I kind of dislike the one in puppet).


As I'm also writing some python, I can see a real difference in expressibility that can be found in ruby. Really, ruby is a maker tool. Like a toolbox for making new programming languages, using meta-programming, lambda and other goodies. This is what, in my opinion, makes ruby unique. Beyond the elegance of its syntax, it empowers developers with the ability to write dedicated programming language for any specific use. And this, I didn't find in python.
