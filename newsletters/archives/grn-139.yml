    "#### Rails Bricks


The author of [Rails Bricks][railsbricks], Nico Schuele, suddenly removed all his works and disappeared from the ruby/rails community.


I got really sad when reading the [quora postuora_link]. Especially when Nico said he replied many emails about using the site, but only got a few that actually reply or just a simple 'thanks'.


When an open source project gets bigger, and there is only one man on it, it feels lonely and stressful. I don't really think money is the reason that made Nico give up, it's the lack of emotional support that started off his fire.


So, if you are using an open source project, please give your best thanks to the authors. Sometimes just a star or :+1: is really enough and can probably save another Rails Bricks.
