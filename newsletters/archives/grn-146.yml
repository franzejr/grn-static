    "#### A Hackhaton in Taipei


In 2 weeks Gandi organizes with .taipei registry a [Hackhaton][Hackhaton] with pretty wide topic. It will be at at the Hi-tech Promotion Center in Taipei on December 5 and 6. I will be there (part of the jury), so if you want to have some week-end fun and are in Taipei at that time, feel free to join in. There will be prizes, free domains and hosting. I would love to see some ruby projects there.
