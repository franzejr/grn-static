    "#### Happy end of 2015


Take good time, use the calendar rotation as a pretext to have good resolutions, get wasted like if you were a teenager (wait, what? we all are teenagers here?), or do whatever makes you happy if like me you prefer to remain sober. See you in 2016.


#### SlackCast 2016


We had a lot of discussion with Nauman Tariq about how to make slack usage more lively, more useful, and such things. We worked together on a concept of event that we want to try next weekend. It will happen next Saturday (Jan 2nd) around 23:00 UTC (more or less 4 hours). If you want to participate, please shoot me an [email][mail], and we'll give you the precise time when we know it, plus the how-to-join-in. It will be a first time, it won't be perfect, but it will be a lot of fun.


Read more about it on the [SlackCast manifesto][manifesto]. You also can join [rubyonrails.link][link], that's where it will happen.
