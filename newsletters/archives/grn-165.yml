    "#### Aprils lame fools


I think there is nothing I hate more than pranks. It's just another way to bully someone else. Even innocent pranks are having victims. Single out the one that fall for it to make laugh the ones that don't. Well, I may very well be a boring fellow. Or it's just that, working so much with information management, any perversion of it seems off.


And then on april fools day, so much goes wrong. The net becomes unreliable. So lame. But I'm not sure if it's the reason there are not that many news articles this week.
