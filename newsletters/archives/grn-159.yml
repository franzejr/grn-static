    "#### Timezones are outdated


This week I checked out [The radical plan to destroy time zones][timesoneplan], which proposes to adopt UTC worldwide. It goes even further in proposing a change in our calendar for adopting the [Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar][hankehenry]. It's not the first time people propose change in our western gregorian calendar system (which is almost 500 yearsold), but it's quite not easy to get anything adopted. 

Still, we developers consider Timezones as one of our nightmares. When we get to our senses we put everything we can in UTC, but there is always the need to get time 'local' at some point. I have honestly little hope that UTC become the worldwide standard, but, hey, we always can dream, right?
