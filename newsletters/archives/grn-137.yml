  "#### Join us on Slack


Since we revived our [slack channel][slack], there is a small group of people lurking there everyday. Mostly in Taiwan timezone, but we get some guests from the americas as well. The result is that more people suggest links along the way. Thanks Ash and ilake, which brought some links to the present newsletter edition.


So, if you want to join the fun, send a mail to news at greenruby,org to get an invite. It's open, english speaking, friendly and quite geeky.


#### Looking for puppeteers


Some time ago I wrote a tool that we needed at Gandi for analyzing our hiera params. We have a lot of nodes and farms and datacenters and cascading params. It's sometimes hard to see what overrides what. So recently I released it in a Gem named [Hieracles][hieracles]. For now that gem works just fine for us, but I would be curious to see if there is anyone out there with a similar setup that could use it. I would love to make this tool more generic, but there are so many ways do to puppet ... So if you wanna give it a try and need some guidance with it, feel free to poke me.
