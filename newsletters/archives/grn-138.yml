  "#### Show your work


There is one thing I'm know for. I'm relentlessly pushing people to publish their code and participate in the open source world. I starting more than 15 years ago and I never stopped. The fact is that it's not easy to open up your possibly messy code to the world. But honestly, better have dirty code out there than nothing.


Beyond the philosophical reasons on should publish his code, there are various practical reasons. Like craftsmen or artists, we depend on a reputation system that includes being visible. Some people write a lot of blog posts and that works too. But the easiest way to get yourself some legitimacy is to have an active github account (or any other public place where code can be seen).


Honestly when I recruit developers, blank github accounts raise a suspicion. And when I meet someone new in a conference or a meetup, I first go to github before checking out linkedin. Don't you? 


So, if you have been thinking about putting more code on github for a while, but it didn't come to reality, just kick your own ass. Take a weekend. If you are more stimulated by interaction, interest some friend for doing a mini private hackathon. You certainly already have a lot of thing that would need just a little bit of cleaning for being released into the wild.


And, if what stimulates you is to have other people nagging you about it, just join our slack channel (send a mail to [mose@greenruby.org][mail] to get an invite, no question asked). I think I will setup some clever page that makes auto-invites like the one they have on ruby-taiwan community. That group has some amazing activity recently (kudos juanito).
