    "#### It's the fault of the bike


Well, in the last two weeks I get short in links gathered on our slack pinned list. Usually I'm reading various RSS feeds while commuting, and I post them on slack, for later one pinning them. Then I have a script in go that will grab all the pinned url, and remove the pins at the moment I use and check them for inclusion in the publication.


But 2 weeks ago, I decided to change my habits and go to the office by bike. It's a 30 minutes ride, and it's very good. But then hare we are: no no way to check RSS on the phone. I'm going to need to find another trick. Because I won't quit the biking.
